Architecture Overview
The system consists of four microservices: Order, Payment, Notification, and API Gateway. Here's how they interact and the role of each:

Order Service:

Purpose: Manages order creation, status updates, and queries.
gRPC Role: Acts as a gRPC server for CreateOrder, GetOrder, and ListOrders endpoints. Acts as a gRPC client when calling the Payment Service to initiate payments.
Kafka Role: Publishes order.created events to Kafka when an order is created. Listens to payment.status-updated events to update order status (e.g., from PENDING to PAID or FAILED).
Database: Stores orders (PostgreSQL).


Payment Service:

Purpose: Handles payment processing via Stripe and updates payment status.
gRPC Role: Acts as a gRPC server for InitiatePayment and CheckPaymentStatus endpoints. No gRPC client role, as it doesn't call other services directly.
Kafka Role: Publishes payment.created and payment.status-updated events to Kafka. Listens to Stripe webhooks (or similar) to update payment status and publishes updates to Kafka.
Database: Stores payment records (PostgreSQL).


Notification Service:

Purpose: Sends email or SMS notifications to users.
gRPC Role: Acts as a gRPC server for SendEmail and SendSMS endpoints. No gRPC client role, as it doesn't call other services directly.
Kafka Role: Listens to order.created and payment.status-updated events to send notifications (e.g., order confirmation or payment status). Publishes notification.sent events to Kafka for logging/audit purposes.
Database: Stores notification records (PostgreSQL).


API Gateway:

Purpose: Acts as the entry point for external clients (e.g., web/mobile apps). Converts JSON requests to Protobuf and routes them to the appropriate gRPC service.
gRPC Role: Acts as a gRPC client, calling Order, Payment, or Notification services based on the request.
Kafka Role: No direct Kafka interaction, as it focuses on request routing.
Database: None (stateless).



Communication Patterns

gRPC: Used for synchronous communication where immediate responses are needed (e.g., creating an order, initiating a payment, or sending a notification). The API Gateway calls gRPC endpoints on the services, and the Order Service may call the Payment Service via gRPC.
Kafka (Sarama): Used for asynchronous event-driven communication. Services publish events to Kafka topics when significant actions occur (e.g., order created, payment status updated). Other services subscribe to these topics to react (e.g., Notification Service sends emails based on order or payment events).
Why Kafka?: Kafka ensures decoupled, scalable, and fault-tolerant communication. For example, if the Notification Service is down, it can process missed events later by consuming from Kafka. Kafka also supports event sourcing and auditing.
Why Sarama?: Sarama is a mature Go client for Kafka, offering high performance and reliability compared to segmentio/kafka-go. It supports advanced features like consumer groups and offset management, which are crucial for robust microservices.

Interaction Flow

Client → API Gateway:

The client sends a JSON request (e.g., POST /orders to create an order).
The API Gateway converts JSON to Protobuf and calls the Order Service's gRPC CreateOrder endpoint.


Order Service → Payment Service:

When creating an order, the Order Service calls the Payment Service's gRPC InitiatePayment endpoint to start the payment process.
The Order Service saves the order (PENDING) and publishes an order.created event to Kafka.


Payment Service → Kafka:

The Payment Service processes the payment (via Stripe), saves the payment record, and publishes a payment.created event.
Upon receiving a Stripe webhook (or similar), it updates the payment status and publishes a payment.status-updated event.


Notification Service ← Kafka:

The Notification Service consumes order.created and payment.status-updated events.
For each event, it sends an email/SMS, saves the notification record, and publishes a notification.sent event.


Order Service ← Kafka:

The Order Service consumes payment.status-updated events to update the order status (e.g., to PAID or FAILED).



Kafka Topics

order-events: For order.created events.
payment-events: For payment.created events.
payment-status-updates: For payment.status-updated events.
notification-events: For notification.sent events.
